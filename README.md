## My process
First, I modified the index.html file and gave the text inside it the structure of three cards wrapped in a container. Then, I styled the card in CSS by using Sass and looking at the designs provided by Frontend Mentor in the design folder, making the container a flex item so every card could change possition depending of the viewport.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Preprocessor for CSS
